This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net Top_inst/input_logic_0/memory__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Top_inst/input_logic_0/memory_reg[7]_i_1/O, cell Top_inst/input_logic_0/memory_reg[7]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
