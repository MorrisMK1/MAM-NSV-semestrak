Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net Top_inst/input_logic_0/lock1_out is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Top_inst/input_logic_0/aquire_f.lock_reg_i_1/O, cell Top_inst/input_logic_0/aquire_f.lock_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
